#### Exploring Various Assessment Models
Before selecting the Shingo model as the basis for my model, I examined various academic sources on assessment models for operational excellence and continuous improvement.

In [1], you'll find the CIRCA CI self-assessment tool, a research-based instrument designed for objective evaluation of continuous improvement within organizations. Moving on to the study referenced in [2], the aim is to create a comprehensive tool that includes operational metrics for lean practices, safety standards, and ergonomic considerations in a workplace or production line.

Then, in [3], the Lean Enterprise Self-Assessment (LESAT) is introduced, developed by the Lean Advancement Initiative (LAI) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Initially designed in collaboration with the aerospace defense sector, LESAT serves as a tool to guide organizations on their Lean implementation journey. I had fun exploring this assessment model, and who knows, it might just inspire a whole new article from me down the road!

The CI self-assessment tool outlined in [1] helps users in positioning their organization within broad levels of CI maturity without providing a detailed "score." In contrast, the study mentioned in [2] concentrates solely on assessing workstations and production areas. The Lean Enterprise Self-Assessment found in [3] primarily centers on the adoption of Lean principles and practices. As a result, my attention will be directed towards the five well-known assessment models mentioned below.

#### Some of the well-known assessment models, according to [4] are:

1) Shingo Assessment; developed by the Shingo Institute, the Shingo Model is based on principles and concepts inspired by Japanese industrial engineer Shigeo Shingo [5]
   
2) European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM); The European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) provides a framework and a set of tools for organizations to assess and improve their performance, focusing strongly on quality, excellence, and continuous improvement [6]
   
3) Malcom Baldrige National Quality Award (MBQA); The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA), also known as the Baldrige Award, is a prestigious U.S. government recognition for exceptional quality and performance excellence, named after Malcolm Baldrige, the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 1981 to 1987, who championed quality management [7]
   
4) Kobayashi 20 Keys of workplace improvement; The "Kobayashi 20 Keys" are principles for workplace improvement by Iwao Kobayashi, a Japanese consultant. These keys emphasize lean manufacturing and continuous improvement to enhance operational performance and quality [8]
   
5) Rapid Plant Assessment (RPA); RPA is a manufacturing assessment tool designed for quick evaluation, aimed at enhancing a facility's performance and efficiency by identifying improvement opportunities. [9]

The image below presents a description of these models, potential drawbacks, and an evaluation of how components of these assessment tools align with the Shingo dimensions and principles with category weights highlighted in blue.

<h5 align="center">Overview of Assessment Models [4]</h5>   

The remaining four assessment models, as mentioned in the [4], fall short in covering all aspects and guiding principles essential for achieving operational excellence—unlike the Shingo Assessment, which encompasses all dimensions of operational excellence. However, the cost associated with conducting the Shingo Assessment limits businesses in assessing their progress toward operational excellence frequently. As a result, many organizations may have to resort to creating their own operational excellence assessment models.

#### Summary

In a nutshell, based on the insights from [4], the Shingo assessment is the true MVP, excelling in all four dimensions of operational greatness. So, naturally, it's the rockstar foundation for my custom-made operational excellence maturity model.
