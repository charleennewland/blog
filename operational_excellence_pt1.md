In my last [blog post](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/post02/process_improvement_failures.md), we had a look at themes underlying process improvement failures. In this blog post, I want to zoom in on the opportunities process improvement failures present for a potential continuous improvement framework. <br>

Before we get into methodologies, models and techniques, I have to clarify the definitions of continuous improvement and operational excellence. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably in the business world; while there is a close association between the two, they are in fact two different things. In this blog post, we will focus on the definition of continuous improvement, and the next blog post will focus on operational excellence.

#### What is Continuous Improvement?
There are several definitions for continuous improvement in academic writing. Although there are similarities between these definitions, they all emphasise a different point of view.
In the work of **Deming** [1] continuous improvement is defined as “Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service (Principle 5 of transformation).” While **Bessant et al**., [2] describes continuous improvement as “A particular bundle of routines which can help an organisation improve what it currently does”. According to **Boer & Gertsen**. [3] continuous improvement is described as “the planned, organised and systematic process of ongoing, incremental and company-wide change of existing practices aimed at improving company performance”.

These definitions outline what an organisation should be doing in terms of continuous improvement, but in this article, I will use the following definition due to its specificity and a strong emphasis on the practical aspect:

**continuous improvement or Kai-Zen (kai - change and zen - well) is defined as a culture of sustained improvement aimed at eliminating waste in all organizational systems and processes and involving all organizational participants [4].**

This implies that every employee should actively and continuously identify and decrease **non-value added** activities, resulting in increased productivity and profitability. Nakajami's work [5] states that after successful continuous improvement implementation, some companies were able to reduce maintenance costs by 15% to 30%, while others revealed a 90% reduction in process defects and a 40% to 50% gain in labour productivity.

#### Value-added and non-value added activities

It is impossible to discuss value-added and non-value added activities without mentioning the lean methodology.
The objective of the lean methodology is to eliminate waste from processes. 

Any activity that, in the eyes of the customer, does not add to the value of a product or service is considered non-value added. Non-value added activities consume resources and, in lean terms, are considered waste in a process. 

Value-added activities are always viewed from the customer's perspective. Value-added activities are those that efficiently and inexpensively transform a product from raw material to finished product. The best way to distinguish value-added from non-value added activities is to ask the following: **“Is the customer willing to pay for it?”**. If the customer is not willing to pay for it, it is considered non-value added.

#### Types of waste
The lean methodology knows eight types of waste:
- defects - products or services that do not meet customers' specifications and require resources to rectify
- overproduction - producing products in excess before they are truly needed
- waiting - wasting time awaiting a preceding process to finish before moving forward
- non-utilized talent - losing time, ideas, skills, and improvements when not involving employees
- transportation - excessive movement of resources or information not essential to the product or service
- inventory - quantities of products, materials, and information beyond what is immediately necessary
- motion - unnecessary movement by people or movement that does not add value to the product or service
- extra-processing - an activity that is not required to produce a product or service.
   <br>

*Not all non-value added activities are unnecessary. Quality control, for instance, does not directly benefit the customer, but it is still a very important part of the process.*

In the aircraft maintenance industry, there is an inspection called Required Inspection Item (RII). This is ‌a specific inspection of any maintenance task that, if done improperly, could result in immediate danger to an aircraft. For an RII, a certified RII inspector must examine (under FAA guidelines) whether the task was performed correctly. Although this inspection could be considered extra processing, it is necessary for both safety and airworthiness.

#### Tools and methods
The field of continuous improvement knows a wide variety of tools and methods. These are the methods used to improve business operations. Each of these techniques has a particular purpose. Some are used for decision-making purposes and others to implement or execute initiatives. One literature review [6] into continuous improvement found 33 different continuous improvement tools, and another [7] lists 85 different improvement methods and tools. 

Contrary to long-held beliefs, these tools and methods can be used in practically all processes and not just in manufacturing processes. Some of these tools and methods are:

- Standards/frameworks
- Lean and Lean Six Sigma
- Benchmarking
- Just in time
- Taguchi methods
- 5S (five S)
- Plan–do–check–act cycle 
- Kanban		 	 	 		
- Value stream mapping
- Failure mode and effect analysis
- Single-minute exchange of die (SMED)

As I previously stated, these are only a few examples. We could go wild if we wanted to. <br>

To create an operational excellence maturity model, we must first grasp the goal of the model's fundamental ideas, which are continuous improvement and operational excellence. In part 1 we concentrated on the definition of continuous improvement, and part 2 will focus on the definition of operational excellence. Part 3 will go through the process of developing an operational excellence maturity model.

#### The primary takeaways here are:

- Continuous improvement is a specific set of procedures that can assist an organisation in eliminating waste and decreasing non-value added activities
- Not all non-value added activities are unnecessary
- The entire organization should be involved in the continuous improvement efforts
- There are numerous tools and techniques available to manage improvement initiatives. The appropriate tool should be chosen based on the situation.
