#### What is operational excellence?
There are various definitions for operational excellence in academic writing, just as there are for continuous improvement. Each one emphasises a different aspect but most share similarities. According to one study [1], there are 32 different definitions, with key focus areas spanning from employee and customer satisfaction to continuous development of operational performance. The common theme across these definitions is that operational excellence refers to the intended result or ideal state for a business.

Operational excellence is described as the “organisational culture of a company, where employees have the ability to identify problems and solve them satisfaction analytically”, according to Aguilera and Ruiz [2]. In the work of Sutton [3] operational excellence is defined as “a strategic focus on maximizing the value for customers through operations with the support of strong leadership, the power of people, the use of industry best practice and the application of value-added technologies.” According to Russel and Koch [4] operational excellence is “reaching the height of operational efficiency through doing things better, faster, and cheaper.” While Wiersema and Treacy [5] define operational excellence as “the strategy organizations use to deliver quality, price, ease of purchase and service in such a manner that no other organization in the industry or sector can match.”

Some of these definitions suggest that operational excellence is a strategy, while others refer to operational excellence as a status that a business should aim to achieve. 

In this post, I will zoom in on the following 2 definitions due to their clarity and simplicity:

1.Operational excellence is an organizational status “where each and every employee can see the flow of value to the customer and fix that flow before it breaks down.”[6]

This definition is dissected in the following overview:

2. In [7] the authors describe operational excellence as a concept that extends beyond individual tools and techniques. It integrates strategic management, organisational culture, and Lean principles. It is a consequence of an enterprise-wide practice of ideal behaviours based on the correct principles.
The emphasis in this description is on organisational culture, behaviours, and enterprise-wide adoption. It includes more than just the utilisation of tools, methods, and procedures. It is about incorporating strategic management and lean principles into organisational culture.
Both definitions underline the significance of correct behaviour by the company's employees in order to achieve operational excellence. This means that the organisation ensures that individuals not only have the knowledge and tools to help the organisation achieve operational excellence but the organization also incorporates the adoption of this behaviour into the organization's culture.

#### Key guidelines for establishing operational excellence.

The Shingo Institute [8] categorizes the fundamental principles for developing operational excellence into the following dimensions:

- Cultural Enablers - enable individuals in the organisation to participate in the transformation journey, progress in their understanding and, build a culture of operational excellence 
- Continuous Process Improvement - every employee must know “what good is,” whether his or her process is creating a good product or service, and they must know what to do if it is not
- Enterprise Alignment - develop management systems that align work and behaviours with principles and direction in ways that are simple, comprehensible, actionable and standardized
- Results - all leaders in the organization share one common responsibility: they are responsible for results

These dimensions are the basis for the operational maturity model in my next blog post.

We have now examined both continuous improvement and operational excellence. Continuous improvement focuses on the use of tools or a collection of tools and concepts (lean, total quality management, six sigma, and just in time) to eliminate waste and decrease non-value added activities on a continuous basis. Operational excellence, in contrast to continuous improvement, integrates improvement concepts into organisational culture.
