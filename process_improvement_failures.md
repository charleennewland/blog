# Learning from mistakes: Reasons behind improvement project failures.

I think we've all experienced instances where the projects we've managed have not met their intended goal. One effective way to see if and why a project has (not) been successful is by doing a good olâ€™ fashioned evaluation round at the end of the project. 

Going through an evaluation cycle on a regular basis can result in a list of reasons for project failures. It can also point out the weaknesses of team members and stakeholders, which gives us all opportunities to improve. No one is perfect, ya'll ðŸ™‚. In reality, there isn't always time to do a proper evaluation. Lucky for us, there is some research out there that can give us an idea of the reasons for improvement failures. I will highlight one that I find particularly intriguing in this post. 

While doing some research for a survey paper that I am writing on continuous improvement, I realised that there is a great deal of interest in the reasons behind improvement project failures, which makes a lot of sense given that McKinsey & Company [1] found that 70% of complicated, large-scale change programs fail. These failures cost the company time and manpower, which in most cases amount to a considerable financial loss. To avoid financial loss, companies should identify the root causes for project failures and design a strategy that will enable them to get the full benefits out of improvement projects.
	 	 		
>*The top ten causes of improvement project failures, as outlined by the empirical study in [2], are as follows:*

- Lack of commitment and support from top management 
- Poor communication practices 
- Incompetent teams
- Inadequate training and learning 
- Faulty selection of process improvement methodology and its associated tools/techniques
- Inappropriate rewards and recognition system/culture 
- Scope creep - Inability to define the scope and lack of Scope management
- Sub-optimal team size and composition
- Inconsistent monitoring and control (lack of expert supervision)
- Resistance to change (partial cooperation by employees).

These reasons are all very interesting and every individual will rate these differently based on their situation. We could go into each of these as separate topics, but to keep this post short, let's have a look at the two most common reasons for improvement project failures (as chosen by respondents in the study).
					
*I. Resistance to change (partial cooperation by employees)*

The major contributors in this area are:
- Employee resistance to change
- Management not understanding the root causes of employee resistance or underperformance and failing to take immediate action
- A lack of strategiesâ€Œ to convince resistant employees to maintain a positive mindset regarding process improvement projects. 

			
*II. Lack of commitment and support from top management* 
>The key drivers in this area are:
		 	 	 		
Top management not being involved in goal setting or project selection.
Lack of top management commitment in project planning and resource allocation
Lack of top management commitment to project implementation, monitoring and controlling.	

To be honest, project failures are seldom unexpected. In many cases, project managers are busy fighting dragons and building team morale throughout the entirety of a project. So the possibility for failure will frequently be identified early on. However, I believe that having an effective change management strategy and managerial involvement and commitment in each part of the project can reduce the chances of an improvement project failing.
