# What are some of the reasons for Process Improvement Failures?

![pro_impro](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/assets/138404574/83bac892-36c2-4d9b-8b70-1052973c97e7)

I think we've all experienced instances where the projects we've managed have not met their intended goal. One effective way to see if and why a project has (not) been successful is by doing a good olâ€™ fashioned evaluation round at the end of a project. 
The goal of such an evaluation is to have a look at:
- what went well and what didn't
- and assess whether the intended goal has been met 

Going through an evaluation cycle on a consistent basis can result in a list of reasons for project failures. It can also point out the weaknesses of team members and stakeholders. No one is perfect, ya'll ðŸ™‚ and in reality there isn't always time to do a proper evaluation. Lucky for us, there is some research out there that can give us an idea of the reasons for improvement failures. I will highlight one that I find particularly intriguing in this post. 

While doing some research for a survey paper that I am writing on continuous improvement, I realised that there is a great deal of interest in the reasons behind improvement project failures, which makes a lot of sense given that McKinsey & Company [1] found that 70% of complicated, large-scale change programs fail. These failures cost the company time and manpower, which in most cases amount to a considerable financial loss. To avoid financial loss, it is wise for companies to identify the causes of improvement project failures so that they can implement a strategy that will help them get the full benefits out of these projects.
	 	 		
>*The top ten causes of improvement project failures, as outlined by an empirical study in [2], are as follows:*

- Lack of commitment and support from top management 
- Poor communication practices 
- Incompetent teams
- Inadequate training and learning 
- Faulty selection of process improvement methodology and its associated tools/techniques
- Inappropriate rewards and recognition system/culture 
- Scope creep - Inability to define the scope and lack of Scope management
- Sub-optimal team size and composition
- Inconsistent monitoring and control (lack of expert supervision)
- Resistance to change (partial cooperation by employees) 

To keep this discussion short, let's look at the two most common reasons for improvement project failures (as chosen by respondents in this study).
					
*I. Resistance to change (partial cooperation by employees)*

According to the study, some of the major contributors in this area are:
- Employee resistance to change
- Management not understanding the root causes of employee resistance or underperformance and failing to take immediate action
- A lack of strategiesâ€Œ to convince resistant employees to maintain a positive mindset regarding process improvement projects 

			
*II. Lack of commitment and support from top management* 
The study shows that the key drivers under this topic are :
		 	 	 		
Top management not being involved in goal setting or project selection.
Lack of top management commitment in project planning and resource allocation
Lack of top management commitment to project implementation, monitoring and controlling
	
To be honest, project failures are seldom unexpected. In many cases, Project Managers fight dragons and try to build morale throughout the entirety of a project. And letâ€™s not get started on sustaining continuous improvement efforts. However, I believe that having an effective change management strategy and managerial involvement and commitment in each part of the project can reduce the chances of an improvement project failing.
