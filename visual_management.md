'Tis the season to be jolly! With Christmas trees, festive decorations, and Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas' becomes the anthem of joy, there's an undeniable magic in the air. Egg-nog, mulled wine, and crackling fireplaces add to the magic. The visual experience of these elements not only tell us that the season is here, but it also amplifies our joy during this time of the year.

This leads us to today's topic: visual management and its role in amplifying the flow of information and improving communication within organizations.
Just as holiday decorations enhance our festive spirit and a well-decorated Christmas tree effectively communicates the season, visual management plays a pivotal role in improving the flow of information and communication within organizations, ultimately increasing the transparency of the value chain. Visual management is also a powerful tool that aligns with the principles of operational excellence by continuous improvement throughout an organization. In my previous blog posts, I  wrote extensively about- [continuous improvement](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt1.md), [operational excellence](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt2.md), and how to achieve operational excellence by implementing an [operational excellence maturity model](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/edit/post03/operational_excellence_maturity_model.md).

According to [A] Visual management and correspondingly, data visualisation is not a new concept. The idea and the tools, in different forms, have been used in many different areas of the world since almost 4,500 years ago. One of the earliest uses is known to be The Egyptian Royal Cubit which was extensively used in construction projects to provide information through visual stimulus.[B]

#### What is Visual Management?
Visual management is quite simply a method to visualise information. The study in [D] identifies visual management as  [‚Ä¶] the placement of plain view of all tools, parts, production activities, and indicator of production system performance so that the status of system can be understood at a glance by everyone evolved. While according to [C]  Visual Management aligns vision, values, goals, and culture with management systems, processes, and stakeholders. It utilizes stimuli that target the five senses‚Äîsight, hearing, feeling, smell, and taste‚Äîto enhance organizational performance. (Liff and Posey, 2004). 
The development of modern visual management practices can be tracked back to mid-1940s when Toyota production system (TPS) was growing. In the late 1940s, out of necessity, as experienced work forces got deployed to war zones, standard work procedures were developed and posted at work cells above each station at Toyota facilities. [A]

Visual management aims to turn processes and production statuses into simple and easily understandable visual overviews and can be divided into 3 types of visuals:
- Instructive visuals; communicate directions, strategic goals, customer expectations and compliance requirements;
- Explanatory visuals; communicate SOPs, work-related information, and workplace organization and maintenance activities;
- Performance-oriented visuals; communicate the status of processes, projects, production, productivity, and performance.

Not only are they a powerful tool to communicate a strategy or direction of to the rest of the organisation but they also play a crucial role in communicating how well the organisation is doing.

#### Types of visual management tools

In various settings, visual management tools play a crucial role in organizational communication. Here are a few commonly used types of visual management tools that enhance workflow, communication, and overall efficiency:

- Kanban Boards; Visualize workflow using cards, tickets or sticky notes with columns representing different process stages
- Andon Systems; Signal problems or abnormalities in production processes, activating lights or signals for quick response and resolution
- Poka-Yoke (Error Proofing); Implement visual cues or mechanisms to prevent errors before they occur, ensuring correct actions through color-coding, shape differentiation, or physical barriers
- Huddle Boards; Large, visible boards utilized in team meetings to discuss goals, progress, and challenges, often featuring key performance indicators (KPIs) and action plans
- Visual Metrics Dashboards; Present key performance metrics through digital or physical displays, facilitating quick analysis and decision-making
- A-Frame Signs; Portable signs commonly used in industrial settings to convey safety information, work status, or other important messages
- Standardized Work Instructions; Provide visual documents outlining step-by-step procedures, utilizing images and minimal text for clarity and consistency
- Visual Inventory Management; Use techniques like color-coded bins, shadow boards, or digital displays to offer a quick visual indication of inventory levels and reorder points
- Flowcharts and Process Maps; Utilize visual representations of processes using symbols and diagrams, aiding team members in understanding sequence and dependencies
- Safety Signs and Markings; Implement visual cues to communicate safety instructions and warnings, encompassing floor markings, labels, and signs for guiding safe behavior.

  #### Benefits of Visual managements
  Visual management offers a range of benefits in organizational settings. Here are some key benefits:

- Increased Transparency; Visual management fosters transparency by making key information readily visible, promoting an open and accountable work environment
- Efficient Problem Solving; Quick identification of issues through visual signals allows for prompt problem-solving and prevents potential bottlenecks or disruptions
- Enhanced Decision-Making; Visual data provides a quick and comprehensive overview, enabling faster and more informed decision-making by leaders and teams
- Employee Engagement; Visual displays create an engaging work environment, encouraging employee involvement and participation in continuous improvement initiatives
Standardized Processes; Visual aids, such as standardized work instructions, help ensure consistency in processes, reducing errors and promoting quality
- Promotes Accountability; Visual displays of goals and progress foster a sense of accountability among team members, encouraging them to meet targets and contribute to overall success
- Supports Lean Principles; Visual management aligns with lean principles, such as Just-in-Time and Kanban, promoting efficiency, waste reduction, and a focus on customer value.

#### Summary
In summary, visual management in the workplace, is like a car's navigation system, it offers advantages such as improved communication, understanding, and a culture of continuous improvement. It provides teams with a clear, real-time understanding of the journey ahead, guiding them through complexities with efficiency. Similar to holiday decorations and a well-decorated Christmas tree that enhance the festive spirit, visual management improves information flow and communication within organizations, ultimately enhancing the transparency of the value chain.
