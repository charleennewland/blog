In one of my earlier blog posts, we introduced Kaizen, leading to discussions on Kaizen events and their execution. A Kaizen event, for those who might have missed it, is typically a week-long session organized to address urgent business risks, address root causes, tackle cross-functional challenges, or uphold continuous improvement practices. We have already covered the first four steps of conducting a Kaizen event in previous posts, starting with [Teams, Goals, and Gemba Walks](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshops.md) (steps 1, 2, and 3 in our 12-step guide), followed by [Value Stream Mapping](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshop_2.md) (step 4 of our guide). Now, moving on to step 5, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), we'll get into the nitty-grittyâ€”kind of like finally figuring out where all those missing socks go in the laundry. Spoiler alert: We might not solve the mystery of the single socks, but at least we'll improve our processes!

In our daily lives, we spend a lot of time trying to solve problems, both in our professional and personal lives. Often, we end up dealing with the symptoms rather than the actual root causes of the problems we've identified. Addressing only the symptoms, rather than the root cause, is like repeatedly inflating a flat tyre without fixing the puncture. Instead of constantly searching for the nearest air pump, it's essential to inspect the tyre, locate the real leak, and repair it to prevent the issue from recurring, even if it seems time-consuming in the short term. It sounds simple, but identifying the true cause requires accuracy, and fortunately, there are specialised tools designed for this, known as root cause analysis (RCA) tools. Let's get into the literature to understand more about RCA. 

**What is Root Cause Analysis?**

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a key part of managing risks and is used in many areas like quality control, engineering, healthcare, and business to find long-term solutions and help with continuous improvement. It aligns with the Kaizen philosophy by providing a methodical approach to identifying long-term solutions. 

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in [1] is defined as a process used to identify the fundamental cause of a problem or incident to prevent its recurrence. This involves not just fixing the immediate issue but examining deeper, systemic issues that lead to the problem. 
By integrating RCA into regular operations, companies can not only fix recurring issues more effectively but also adopt a more proactive approach to risk management and continuous improvement, leading to more sustainable, long-term operational success. Root Cause Analysis Improving Performance for Bottom-Line Results

**The research in [2] (Techniques for Root Cause Analysis" by Patricia M. Williams) describes 3 types of root causes:**

- **Physical Root Causes** - include tangible, identifiable faults such as broken machine parts or software malfunctions, representing the most immediate symptoms of deeper issues.
Fixing these physical elements may solve the immediate problem but does not prevent future incidents without addressing the underlying causes.

- **Human Root Causes** - human root causes stem from errors or poor decisions influenced by factors like inadequate training, unclear instructions, or fatigue.
Addressing human root causes involves creating an environment that encourages learning from errors rather than assigning blame.

- **Latent Root Causes** - latent root causes are systemic and organisational flaws such as poor design, inadequate maintenance schedules, or a non-supportive culture.
Latent causes are challenging to identify and address because they need substantial organisational changes to prevent recurrence. Solving these issues is vital for long-term improvement, requiring modifications to the underlying systems, processes, or cultures that allow errors.

The main takeaway here is that effective problem-solving requires addressing the deeper systemic and human factors beyond just the immediate physical causes. 

**A RCA process involves the following key steps:**

- **Data Collection:** Gather all relevant information about the issue.
- **Define the Problem:** Clearly describe the problem and its impact.
- **Identify Possible Causal Factors:** List all potential reasons that could have led to the issue.
- **Identify the Root Cause:** Use RCA methods to drill down to the underlying cause.
- **Recommend and Implement Solutions:** Propose solutions to address the root cause and put them into action.
- **Monitor and Review:** Ensure the solutions are effective and prevent the recurrence of the issue.

  In the next section, we'll explore the various tools available for conducting proper root cause analysis.
  

**The various, commonly known tools used for Root Cause Analysis are:**
- Cause-and-effect Diagram (CED) - this tool helps in organizing possible reasons for a problem, fostering structure and promoting the collection of information. However, it might not pinpoint the exact root causes and could miss how these causes are connected. [3]
- Interrelationship Diagram (ID) - This helps clarify complex relationships among multiple factors, helping in identifying, analyzing, and classifying cause-and-effect relationships, but it may not explicitly point out root causes. [3]
- Current Reality Tree (CRT) - Focuses on pinpointing root causes and identifying how different causes are connected by linking multiple factors to core problems. It's detailed but can be complicated and slow to build.[3]
- "Ask Why 5 Times" Technique - Involves asking "why" multiple times (typically five) to delve deeper into the cause of a problem. [2]
- Causal Tree - Places the main event at the top and then goes backwards to find the causes and their interrelations, showing how different reasons are connected and finding ways to prevent errors from happening. [2]
- Decision Table - Assesses actions by how serious they are, how likely they are to happen again, and detectability, helping in informed decision-making instead of knee-jerk reactions. [2]
- Fishbone Diagrams (Ishikawa) - Helps identify multiple potential causes of a problem and categorise them. This tool is used to systematically break down factors leading to specific issues. [4] Juran, J. M. (1999). Juran's Quality Handbook (5th Edition). McGraw-Hill. 
- Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) - Used primarily in technical or complex scenarios like airline mechanical failures. FTA helps trace back issues through a logical sequence to identify potential design flaws or system failures. [5] Kabir, S. (2017). An overview of fault tree analysis and its application in model based dependability analysis. Expert Systems with Applications, 77, 114-135.
- Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - Is a systematic method for identifying potential failure modes within a process, product, or system, assessing their potential effects, and prioritizing actions to prevent them. Used not only for identifying potential product or process failures but also for risk management, quality improvement, safety analysis, cost reduction, design optimization, regulatory compliance, and supply chain management. [6] MIL-STD 1629A https://www.dsiintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mil_std_1629a.pdf

These tools help in identifying not just what went wrong, but why it went wrong, helping in developing effective solutions to prevent future occurrences.

**Here is a simple example of the 5 Whys technique applied to a problem:**
**Problem: Product shipment is consistently delayed.**
- **First Why** - Why was the product shipment delayed?
>The packaging process took longer than expected.
- **Second Why** - Why did the packaging process take longer than expected?
>The packaging instructions were unclear.
- **Third Why** - Why were the packaging instructions unclear?
>They hadn't been updated to reflect changes in the product design.
- **Fourth Why** - Why hadn't the packaging instructions been updated?
>The process to regularly review and update procedures was not followed and there was no mechanism for identifying outdated procedures.
- **Fifth Why** - Why wasn't the process followed and why was there no mechanism for identifying outdated procedures?
>There was no systematic adherence control mechanism in place.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the shipment delays is the lack of a structured process for reviewing, updating, and adhering to procedures.

**Solution:** Implementing a clear process for updates, assigning responsibility, and establishing adherence control mechanisms such as routine audits, feedback loops, training sessions, responsibility assignments, and performance metrics can help prevent future shipment delays.

After following the above mentioned steps, we end up with the following image, which is the current state map:

</p>

<h5 align="center"> Current State Map</h1>  

In the current state map, we find that the cycle time (C/T), which is how long it takes to finish one unit of work, is 17 minutes. The processing time (P/T) or value-added time (VAT), which is the time spent on tasks that directly add value, is 10 minutes. The total time (T), which includes both value-added and non-value-added tasks, is 33 minutes. This shows that non-value-added tasks or delays are causing the total time to be longer than the value-added time. 

While analyzing the value stream map, I've chosen not to highlight waste types to keep the visual clear and easy to understand. The focus has been on identifying process flows, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities. 

The current state map provides a baseline for comparison when designing a future state map. To create the future state map, follow these steps:

- **Create a leaner process** that eliminates or reduces waste, improves flow, and better aligns production with customer demand, based on the analysis of the current state;
- **Develop a future state map** that reflects these improvements, including changes to process steps, material and information flows. Clearly define the goals for the future state, including target metrics (e.g., cycle time, productivity).
  
Below is a table outlining the activities in the customer call process, detailing their processing times or value-added times, cycle times, total times, process step efficiencies, and suggested improvements/solutions resulting from root cause analysis and brainstorming (steps 5, 6, and 7 of our Kaizen guide). We'll delve deeper into these steps in future posts. When initiating improvements, focus first on areas with low efficiency.

<h5 align="center"> Process Data and Improvements</h1>  

The future state map illustrates the ideal process post-improvements, guiding the transition from the current state. In our example, there are improvements in cycle time, processing time, and total time. Currently, cycle time is 17 minutes, value-added time is 10 minutes, and total time is 33 minutes. In contrast, the future state targets a cycle time of 11 minutes, a value-added time of 8 minutes, and a total time of 14 minutes. These improvements represent a significant reduction in cycle and total times, requiring considerable effort to implement and sustain. Below you will find the future state map:

<h5 align="center"> Future State Map</h1>  

Successfully implementing these changes will lead to the following quantifiable improvements:

Currently, each call center representative (CCR) handles an average of 28.24 calls per day. After successfully implementing the proposed changes, this figure will increase to 43.64 calls per day per CCR, marking an increase of 54.55%. Alongside this increase, there are also intangible benefits. These include an increase in employee satisfaction due to the standardization and simplification of process steps, which can also lead to higher employee retention rates.

**Brown Paper Sessions**

Brown paper sessions are not the same as value stream mapping, but they are often used in conjunction with each other as part of a process improvement initiative.

A brown paper session is an interactive meeting where participants use large sheets of brown paper to visually represent ideas, processes, or plans. These sessions are common in brainstorming and process improvement exercises, with participants using markers, sticky notes, or other visual aids for easy sharing and collaboration.

Brown paper sessions can be used as part of the value stream mapping process to brainstorm ideas, gather input from team members, and visually represent the current state and future state of a process. While I prefer the brown paper approach, Minitab Workspace and Miro are great alternatives for VSM with remote teams.

Here is an image illustrating what a brown paper session looks like.

Summary:
- VSM visualizes each task involved in creating a product or service and helps identify waste, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies;
- To create a VSM, tools such as whiteboards, flip chart paper, or VSM software can be utilized for visualization;
- To develop a leaner process that eliminates or reduces waste and enhances flow, we must analyze the current state map;
- Improvements, including modifications to process steps, material and information flows, and other key metrics, will be documented in the future state map.
