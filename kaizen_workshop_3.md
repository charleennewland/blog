In one of my earlier blog posts, we introduced Kaizen, leading to discussions on Kaizen events and their execution. A Kaizen event, for those who might have missed it, is typically a week-long session organized to address urgent business risks, address root causes, tackle cross-functional challenges, or uphold continuous improvement practices. We have already covered the first four steps of conducting a Kaizen event in previous posts, starting with [Teams, Goals, and Gemba Walks](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshops.md) (steps 1, 2, and 3 in our 12-step guide), followed by [Value Stream Mapping](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshop_2.md) (step 4 of our guide). Now, moving on to step 5, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), we'll get into the nitty-gritty—kind of like finally figuring out where all those missing socks go in the laundry. Spoiler alert: We might not solve the mystery of the single socks, but at least we'll improve our processes!

While researching value stream mapping, I realized that the topic deserves its own article due to the amount of information available. This is why I decided to create a standalone piece for value stream mapping.

In case you missed it, here's your high-level guide to rocking a kaizen event:

First, make sure that team members are trained in or are familiar with Lean principles, as these often are the basis of kaizen activities. Remember, not every problem needs a kaizen event or workshop.

1. **Form a cross-functional team**, including members associated with the process;
2. **Define goals and objectives** for the kaizen event;
3. **Conduct a Gemba walk** in the actual workplace;
4. **Create a Value Stream Map (VSM)** to identify opportunities for improvements in the process;
5. **Analyze the root causes** of the identified issues;
6. **Facilitate brainstorming sessions** to share ideas for improvement;
7. **Develop potential solutions** to address the identified issues;
8. **Create a detailed plan** for implementing proposed solutions, defining responsibilities, timelines, and key performance indicators (KPIs);
9. **Run a pilot** to test and refine potential solutions;
10. **Implement planned changes**, adjusting processes and workflows;
11. **Monitor these changes** and evaluate their impact on the process using metrics and KPIs;
12. **Document the entire kaizen event** for future reference and follow-up. 

We've covered steps 1, 2, and 3 in the [previous post](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshops.md). In this blog post, we will examine **step 4, which involves creating a Value Stream Map**.

**What does academic literature say about Value Stream Mapping?**

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a lean-management tool that originated from the Toyota Production System, developed in the late 1940s and 1950s. The authors in [1] who popularized VSM attribute its principles, such as focusing on value-added activities and eliminating waste, to the lean manufacturing methods developed within the Toyota Production System, primarily by Taiichi Ohno. At its most basic level, it visualises each task in the creation of a service or product, helping us pinpoint waste, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies, all geared towards process optimization. This visualization helps us understand the time each step takes and the distinction between value-added and non-value-added steps within the process. 

According to [2] there are three types of activities that a process consists of. These can be categorized as:
1. non-value added (NVA);
2. necessary but non-value added (NNVA); and
3. value-added (VA).

In process improvement, the goal is to minimize Non-Value Added (NVA) activities, which do not contribute to customer value, while optimizing Necessary but Non-Value Added (NNVA) tasks. The focus lies in improving Value-Added (VA) activities that directly fulfill customer needs. All of these are aimed at reducing inefficiencies/waste, increasing productivity, and ultimately improving the overall effectiveness of the process.

**Types of waste**

In one of my earlier blog posts on [continuous improvement](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt1.md), I mentioned the eight types of waste the lean philosophy knows. The acronym DOWNTIME is an easy way to remember the eight wastes:

- Defects - products or services that do not meet customers' specifications and require resources to rectify;
- Overproduction - producing products in excess before they are truly needed;
- Waiting - wasting time awaiting a preceding process to finish before moving forward;
- Non-utilized talent - losing time, ideas, skills, and improvements when not involving employees;
- Transportation - excessive movement of resources or information not essential to the product or service;
- Inventory - quantities of products, materials, and information beyond what is immediately necessary;
- Motion - unnecessary movement by people or movement that does not add value to the product or service;
- Extra-processing - an activity that is not required to produce the product or service.

**Navigating the Practical Jungle of Value Stream Mapping**

Now that we've discussed the theoretical background, let's explore the practical steps needed to create a VSM. We'll use a call center with made-up figures as our example.
As the needs of the customers of this call center have developed, the team recognizes the need to improve and elevate the services.

Picture this: with colorful sticky notes, markers, and a whiteboard at hand, you and your team are all set to tackle the task of creating the Value Stream Map. If you find yourselves unsure of the next steps, don't worry — I'm here to help guide you through the process.

Here are the steps you need to take:

- **Draw the map:** Use a whiteboard, flip chart paper, or VSM software to create a visual representation of the current state of the value stream;
- **Identify process steps** Map out the sequence of activities involved in delivering the product or service, including material and information flows;
- **Capture metrics:** Collect data by gathering information on the time required to complete each step in the process. This can be achieved through observation, the use of time tracking software, or by seeking input from employees. Document key performance indicators (KPIs) such as cycle time, processing time, total time and process efficiency for each process step;
- **Highlight waste:** Identify and mark areas of waste, including overproduction, waiting time, excess inventory, and unnecessary processing;
- **Identify bottlenecks:** Determine points in the value stream where work accumulates or slows down, leading to inefficiencies;
- **Evaluate flow:** Assess the smoothness and continuity of material and information flow throughout the value stream.

After following the above mentioned steps, we end up with the following image, which is the current state map:
<p align="center">
  <img width="1800" height="500" src="https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/assets/138404574/3a5f9d47-780d-48b5-a899-a2e4d41c6cab/600/300"> 
</p>
</p>
<h5 align="center"> Current State Map</h1>  

In the current state map, we find that the cycle time (C/T), which is how long it takes to finish one unit of work, is 17 minutes. The processing time (P/T) or value-added time (VAT), which is the time spent on tasks that directly add value, is 10 minutes. The total time (T), which includes both value-added and non-value-added tasks, is 33 minutes. This shows that non-value-added tasks or delays are causing the total time to be longer than the value-added time. 

While analyzing the value stream map, I've chosen not to highlight waste types to keep the visual clear and easy to understand. The focus has been on identifying process flows, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities. 

The current state map provides a baseline for comparison when designing a future state map. To create the future state map, follow these steps:

- **Create a leaner process** that eliminates or reduces waste, improves flow, and better aligns production with customer demand, based on the analysis of the current state;
- **Develop a future state map** that reflects these improvements, including changes to process steps, material and information flows. Clearly define the goals for the future state, including target metrics (e.g., cycle time, productivity).
  
Below is a table outlining the activities in the customer call process, detailing their processing times or value-added times, cycle times, total times, process step efficiencies, and suggested improvements/solutions resulting from root cause analysis and brainstorming (steps 5, 6, and 7 of our Kaizen guide). We'll delve deeper into these steps in future posts. When initiating improvements, focus first on areas with low efficiency.

<h5 align="center"> Process Data and Improvements</h1>  

The future state map illustrates the ideal process post-improvements, guiding the transition from the current state. In our example, there are improvements in cycle time, processing time, and total time. Currently, cycle time is 17 minutes, value-added time is 10 minutes, and total time is 33 minutes. In contrast, the future state targets a cycle time of 11 minutes, a value-added time of 8 minutes, and a total time of 14 minutes. These improvements represent a significant reduction in cycle and total times, requiring considerable effort to implement and sustain. Below you will find the future state map:

</p>
</p>
<h5 align="center"> Future State Map</h1>  

Successfully implementing these changes will lead to the following quantifiable improvements:

Currently, each call center representative (CCR) handles an average of 28.24 calls per day. After successfully implementing the proposed changes, this figure will increase to 43.64 calls per day per CCR, marking an increase of 54.55%. Alongside this increase, there are also intangible benefits. These include an increase in employee satisfaction due to the standardization and simplification of process steps, which can also lead to higher employee retention rates.

**Brown Paper Sessions**

Brown paper sessions are not the same as value stream mapping, but they are often used in conjunction with each other as part of a process improvement initiative.

A brown paper session is an interactive meeting where participants use large sheets of brown paper to visually represent ideas, processes, or plans. These sessions are common in brainstorming and process improvement exercises, with participants using markers, sticky notes, or other visual aids for easy sharing and collaboration.

Brown paper sessions can be used as part of the value stream mapping process to brainstorm ideas, gather input from team members, and visually represent the current state and future state of a process. While I prefer the brown paper approach, Minitab Workspace and Miro are great alternatives for VSM with remote teams.

Here is an image illustrating what a brown paper session looks like.

Summary:
- VSM visualizes each task involved in creating a product or service and helps identify waste, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies;
- To create a VSM, tools such as whiteboards, flip chart paper, or VSM software can be utilized for visualization;
- To develop a leaner process that eliminates or reduces waste and enhances flow, we must analyze the current state map;
- Improvements, including modifications to process steps, material and information flows, and other key metrics, will be documented in the future state map.
