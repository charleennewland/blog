In one of my earlier blog posts, we introduced Kaizen, leading to discussions on Kaizen events and their execution. A Kaizen event, for those who might have missed it, is typically a week-long session organized to address urgent business risks, address root causes, tackle cross-functional challenges, or uphold continuous improvement practices. We have already covered the first four steps of conducting a Kaizen event in previous posts, starting with [Teams, Goals, and Gemba Walks](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshops.md) (steps 1, 2, and 3 in our 12-step guide), followed by [Value Stream Mapping](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshop_2.md) (step 4 of our guide). Now, moving on to step 5, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), we'll get into the nitty-gritty—kind of like finally figuring out where all those missing socks go in the laundry. Spoiler alert: We might not solve the mystery of the single socks, but at least we'll improve our processes!

Both in our professional and personal lives, we spend a lot of time trying to solve problems. Often, we end up dealing with the symptoms rather than the actual root causes of the problems we deal with. Addressing only the symptoms, rather than the root cause, is like repeatedly inflating a flat tyre without fixing the puncture. Instead of constantly searching for the nearest air pump, it's essential to inspect the tyre, locate the real leak, and repair it to prevent the issue from recurring, even if it seems time-consuming in the short term. It sounds simple, but identifying the true cause requires accuracy, and fortunately, there are specialised tools designed for this, known as root cause analysis (RCA) tools. Let's get into the literature to understand more about RCA. 

**What is Root Cause Analysis?**

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a key part of managing risks and is used in many areas like quality control, engineering, healthcare, and business to find long-term solutions and help with continuous improvement. It aligns with the Kaizen philosophy by providing a methodical approach to leading to long-term solutions. 

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in [1] is defined as a process used to identify the fundamental cause of a problem or incident to prevent its recurrence. This involves not just fixing the immediate issue but examining deeper, systemic issues that lead to the problem. 
By integrating RCA into regular operations, companies can not only fix recurring issues more effectively but also adopt a more proactive approach to risk management and continuous improvement, leading to more sustainable, long-term operational success.

The research in [2] outlines three types of root causes: physical (tangible issues like broken parts), human (errors due to factors like poor training), and organizational (systemic flaws within the organization). Fixing these issues takes more than quick fixes; real problem-solving means making big changes to systems, processes, and culture to prevent recurrence and achieve long-term improvement.

**Here are the basic steps to follow when conducting a root cause analysis:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gather all relevant information about the issue.
2. **Define the Problem:** Clearly describe the problem and its impact.
3. **Identify Possible Causal Factors:** List all potential reasons that could have led to the issue.
4. **Identify the Root Cause:** Use RCA methods to drill down to the underlying cause.
5. **Recommend and Implement Solutions:** Propose solutions to address the root cause and put them into action.
6. **Monitor and Review:** Ensure the solutions are effective and prevent the recurrence of the issue.

  Interesting, right? But we're here to learn about the methods.
  Now, let's move on to exploring the RCA methods, which will help us tackle complex problems.
  
**The various, commonly known tools used for Root Cause Analysis are:**
- *Cause-and-effect Diagram (CED)* - this tool helps in organizing possible reasons for a problem, fostering structure and promoting the collection of information. However, it might not pinpoint the exact root causes and could miss how these causes are connected. [3]
- *Interrelationship Diagram (ID)* - This helps clarify complex relationships among multiple factors, helping in identifying, analyzing, and classifying cause-and-effect relationships, but it may not explicitly point out root causes. [3]
- *Current Reality Tree (CRT)* - Focuses on pinpointing root causes and identifying how different causes are connected by linking multiple factors to core problems. It's detailed but can be complicated and slow to build.[3]
- *"Ask Why 5 Times" Technique* - Involves asking "why" multiple times (typically five) to delve deeper into the cause of a problem. [2]
- *Causal Tree* - Places the main event at the top and then goes backwards to find the causes and their interrelations, showing how different reasons are connected and finding ways to prevent errors from happening. [2]
- *Decision Table* - Assesses actions by how serious they are, how likely they are to happen again, and detectability, helping in informed decision-making instead of knee-jerk reactions. [2]
- *Fishbone Diagrams (Ishikawa)* - Helps identify multiple potential causes of a problem and categorise them. This tool is used to systematically break down factors leading to specific issues. [4] 
- *Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)* - Used primarily in technical or complex scenarios like airline mechanical failures. FTA helps trace back issues through a logical sequence to identify potential design flaws or system failures. [5] 
- *Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)* - Is a systematic method for identifying potential failure modes within a process, product, or system, assessing their potential effects, and prioritizing actions to prevent them. Used not only for identifying potential product or process failures but also for risk management, quality improvement, safety analysis, cost reduction, design optimization, regulatory compliance, and supply chain management. [6] 

These tools help in identifying not just what went wrong, but why it went wrong, helping in developing effective solutions to prevent future occurrences. Now, let's take a look at one of these RCA methods.

**A simple example of applying the 5 Whys technique to a problem looks like this:** :nerd_face:

**Problem: Product shipment is consistently delayed.**
- [x] **First Why** - Why was the product shipment delayed?
>The packaging process took longer than expected.
- [x] **Second Why** - Why did the packaging process take longer than expected?
>The packaging instructions were unclear.
- [x] **Third Why** - Why were the packaging instructions unclear?
>They hadn't been updated to reflect changes in the product design.
- [x] **Fourth Why** - Why hadn't the packaging instructions been updated?
>The process to regularly review and update procedures was not followed and there was no mechanism for identifying outdated procedures.
- [x] **Fifth Why** - Why wasn't the process followed and why was there no mechanism for identifying outdated procedures?
>There was no systematic adherence control mechanism in place.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the shipment delays is the lack of a structured process for reviewing, updating, and adhering to procedures.

**Solution:** Implementing a clear process for updates, assigning responsibility, and establishing adherence control mechanisms such as routine audits, feedback loops, training sessions, responsibility assignments, and performance metrics can help prevent future shipment delays.

You will find another example of an RCA for a real-life incident at the bottom of this blog post.

**Complexities and Challenges of RCA**

While a well-executed RCA can lead to real long-term solutions, there are still some limitations and challenges associated with it. 

An RCA study in healthcare [7] lists several important points to be mindful of:
- **The Myth of the Single Root Cause:** One common misconception about RCA is the idea that every problem stems from a singular root cause. This belief can lead to an overly simplistic view. Adopting a systems thinking approach and encouraging collaborative problem-solving can help avoid oversimplification and ensure comprehensive solutions.
  > While the idea that every problem has a single root cause is a common belief in root cause analysis (RCA), not everyone agrees with this perspective. Some individuals prefer to distinguish between immediate causes and deeper root causes, and they are welcome to do so. Ultimately, the goal is to address and resolve issues to prevent their recurrence, whether through identifying single root causes or multiple contributing factors. 
- **Focus on Solutions:** Often, RCAs result in solutions that emphasize quick administrative fixes over deeper, systemic changes, leading to risk controls that might not fully address the underlying problems. Avoid these by developing action plans and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution.
- **Scope of Analysis:** Many RCAs examine incidents in isolation, within the limits of one department or organization, missing out on broader lessons that could lead to systemic changes. Avoid this by using thorough data collection and involving team members from different areas.


**Cultivating Continuity**

After an RCA journey, it's crucial to not just applaud and move on but to lay down the tracks for continuous growth. This involves setting clear, actionable follow-up tasks, assigning caretakers for these tasks, and setting milestones to ensure they’re not just completed but integrated smoothly into the daily routines. Celebrate the wins, no matter how small, and use any setbacks as learning steps, not stumbling blocks.

**RCA Software**

There are several RCA software options out there that can help streamline the RCA process. Some of the best ones are SafetyCulture (used to be called iAuditor), TapRooT, Causelink, EHS Insight, Weever, EasyRCA by Reliability, and ThinkReliability. They come with stuff like digital checklists for RCA, data analysis, managing incidents, and ways for teams to collaborate on figuring things out.

In my next blog post, we will proceed with step six in our 12-step Kaizen guide. 

**So, to summarize**: :monocle_face:

- Root cause analysis as a Crucial Element: RCA is essential in identifying the fundamental reasons behind issues, moving beyond temporary fixes to achieve sustainable solutions and fostering a culture of continuous improvement in line with Kaizen principles.
- Understanding Problem Layers: Addressing problems requires more than just superficial fixes. By delving deeper into the root causes, whether they're physical, human, or latent, organizations can implement more effective and long-lasting solutions.
- RCA Tools and Techniques: A variety of tools, from the 5 Whys technique to Fishbone Diagrams and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, can help systematically uncover the underlying causes of issues, guiding towards better decision-making and preventive measures.
- Practical Application and Challenges: While RCA offers significant benefits, it comes with challenges such as the misconception of single root causes and the need for a systematic approach to ensure real and long-term improvements.

> Root cause analysis by ThinkReliability titled "Incident: Unaccompanied Minor Flown to the Wrong City."

> Problem: An unaccompanied minor was placed on the wrong flight by a U.S. airline, leading to the child flying to a different city than intended. This incident was not isolated; another similar occurrence happened the next day with the same airline.

> Root Cause Findings:

> Miscommunication Among Staff: Two flights departing simultaneously from the same gate led to confusion and miscommunication, resulting in the child being placed on the incorrect flight.

> Ineffective Verification Process: The current process for verifying that minors are boarded onto the correct flights was found to be ineffective.

> Count Ineffective: The flight attendant’s passenger count did not catch the error; on the "wrong" aircraft, the count was one more than expected, and on the "correct" aircraft, it was one less than expected.

> Process Breakdowns: There were multiple breakdowns within the work processes, particularly in escorting the child to the plane, verifying the child’s boarding process, and counting passengers accurately.

> Outcomes/Solutions:

>Reinforce Procedures: The initial solution proposed by the airline was to reinforce procedures with employees, a response deemed too generic and simplistic for the complex issue at hand.

> Specific Process Improvements: The detailed analysis suggested the need for specific improvements to prevent reoccurrence, such as improving communication among staff, enhancing the boarding pass-checking process, and refining the passenger counting process.

> Implement Process Maps: The study emphasizes the importance of using process maps to identify where breakdowns occurred and how to identify specific solutions.

>The case highlights the necessity of detailed analysis and specific solutions beyond general procedural reinforcements to address systemic issues effectively and prevent future occurrences.
