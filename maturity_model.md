In the hustle and bustle of today's world, operational excellence isn't just a choice; it's a vital necessity for those aiming for long-term success.  Implementing an operational excellence maturity model is a key approach to achieve this. Some organizations turn to existing operational excellence maturity models or engage with assessment companies for guidance. However, not every organisation can do so, whether for financial reasons or privacy concerns. Existing assessment models or tools may not always perfectly align with the needs and characteristics of every organization or work stream.

Creating a customized model enables an organization to focus on specific critical areas or processes vital for its success. This blog post will explore the process of developing a maturity model for operational excellence.

To develop an operational excellence maturity model, it is essential to understand the fundamental ideas underpinning the model. In my previous blog posts, I delved into both of these - [continuous improvement](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt1.md)  and [operational excellence](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt2.md). With that foundational knowledge in place, let's now direct our attention to the operational excellence maturity model. 

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of what it takes to whip up a tailor-made operational excellence maturity model, let's kick things off with a lighthearted exploration of what in the world a maturity model is, shall we?

#### What exactly do we mean when we say "Maturity Model"?

A quick online search will produce numerous examples of maturity models applied across different industries. These models help organizations identify organizational gaps and strengths, which they can then use to develop a proper roadmap to improve crucial workflows or initiatives.

Picture a maturity model like a ladder; at its core, it's made up of assessment criteria, forming the rungs of the ladder, and various maturity levels, all tied together with a handy scoring system. It's like a roadmap for leveling up in excellence!

The study referenced in [1] defines a maturity model as a development of an entity over time. This entity or object can cover a wide range of subjects, from individuals to organizational functions.‌ A maturity model serves as a tool for assessing an organization's performance and continuous growth in a specific domain. Maturity models can be used in a wide range of domains, from project management and software development to information security and operational excellence.

#### Perks of an Operational Excellence Maturity Model

Organizations usually focus on quick gains, but making lasting changes requires a mix of short-term wins and long-term goals. Operational excellence helps strike this balance, which is vital for an organization's survival. Now, let's quickly explore some of the advantages of an operational excellence maturity model.

The benefits of an operational excellence maturity model according to [2] are:

- *Continuous Improvement* - promotes a culture of continuous improvement throughout the organization;
- *Strategic Harmony* - aligns operational strategies with company objectives for a unified strategy;
- *Optimized Resource Utilization* - assists in efficient resource utilization, leading to cost savings and increased production;
- *Effective Risk Management and Compliance* - helps in identifying and managing risks, ensuring compliance, and adherence to standards;
- *Informed Decision-Making* - promotes data-driven decisions essential for long-term success.

#### What essentials are required for a top-notch Operational Excellence Maturity Model?

Time for a sneak peek into the essential and specific requirements for an operational excellence maturity model!

In theory, you have the flexibility to select the principles to base your maturity model on, as long as they align with the organization's goals. I will base our model for this blog post on the Shingo model, since it aligns with the definitions covered in my earlier [blog post on operational excellence](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt2.md).

As per the Shingo Institute [2], the fundamental principles for achieving operational excellence are categorized into the following dimensions:

- *Cultural Enablers* - enable individuals in the organisation to participate in the transformation journey, progress in their understanding and build a culture of operational excellence;
- *Continuous Process Improvement* - every employee must know “what good is,” whether his or her process is creating a good product or service, and they must know what to do if it is not;
- *Enterprise Alignment* - develop management systems that align work and behaviours with principles and direction in ways that are simple, comprehensible, actionable and standardized;
- *Results* - all leaders in the organization share one common responsibility: they are responsible for results.

These are the principles that the customized maturity model will be based on. However, for the model, I've broken them down into different dimensions and renamed some, as you will see later on in this post.

#### Exploring Established Assessment Models

Prior to choosing the Shingo model as the foundation for the customized model, I reviewed several academic sources on assessment models related to operational excellence and continuous improvement. Here is detailed information about the [five assessment models (including the Shingo model)](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/post03/Assessment_models.md) that I've researched for this blog post.
 
According to the insights shared in [3], the Shingo assessment distinguishes itself as the only assessment tool that achieves the most well-balanced weighted score across all four dimensions necessary for achieving operational excellence. These four assessment models fail to cover all aspects or guiding principles that lead to operational excellence, as opposed to the Shingo Assessment, which covers all dimensions of operational excellence. However, the expense associated with conducting the Shingo Assessment restricts the ability and frequency of businesses to assess their advancement toward operational excellence. Many organisations will have to fend with creating their own operational excellence assessment models.

#### A tailor-made Operational Excellence Maturity Model

The operational excellence maturity model I've designed serves as an assessment tool to gauge an organization's progress in its operational excellence journey.

The model consists of the following 5 dimensions:

- Cultural enablers
- Excellence-Driven Framework
- Quality Management
- Enterprise Alignment
- Results

I created this breakdown because, while it covers the fundamental principles outlined by the Shingo Institute [2], it is divided into more manageable and dissectible sections—specifically the focus areas. I designed the model to integrate Continuous Improvement into the broader concept of an Excellence-Driven Framework. Additionally, I ensured that Quality Management stands as a distinct and standalone dimension, allowing it to be broken down into various essential and more manageable focus areas. This is designed to improve the assessor's experience, making the entire assessment process more manageable.

#### How does it work?

The image below shows the breakdown I created, categorizing these dimensions into various focus areas.

<h5 align="center">Operational Excellence Dimensions and Focus Areas</h5>   

This resulted in a full-blown custom-made maturity model complete with all the focus areas mentioned above. The image below showcases four lines from this model, each depicting the following five distinct levels for every focus area:

- *Level 1: Emerging - Reactive Approach:*
the organization has a reactive and ad-hoc approach to the subject, limited awareness and response to issues and minimal processes in place;

- *Level 2: Learning - Basic Understanding:*
the organization is developing a basic understanding of the subject, initial efforts to learn and implement basic processes, limited documentation and inconsistent practices;

- *Level 3: Committing - Standardized/Defined Approach:*
the organization commits to a standardized or defined approach to the subject, well-established processes with documentation, consistent application of practices across the organization;

- *Level 4: Accelerating - Proactive Approach:*
the organization has a proactive approach to the subject, adoption of innovative practices to enhance effectiveness;

- *Level 5: Excelling - Optimized Approach:*
The organization excels with an optimized approach to the subject, processes are highly efficient, streamlined, and well-optimized, and effectiveness is checked with evidence of compliance.

With each level specifying its requirements, the organization must fulfill the criteria for both the higher level and the ones preceding it. The ultimate goal for an organization is to score a 5, which means reaching Level 5 or coming close to it in each focus area.

Once all focus areas have been assessed, the organization is assigned a total operational excellence score, allowing it to focus on and address areas with lower scores.

<h5 align="center"> Excerpt of Customized Operational Excellence Maturity Model</h5>  

Let's move forward and take a closer look at line 13 in this maturity model as an example. It falls under the dimension 'Excellence-Driven Framework', within the focus area of 'Excellence-Driven Policy'.

If an organization has no documented excellence-driven policy, as in this example, it essentially scores a 2 (Level 2) in this focus area, which is relatively low. The organization can then decide, for example, to aim for Level 5 in the next quarter.

In that case, the organization needs to ensure that during the next assessment round:

- [x] there is a documented excellence-driven policy;
- [x] the policy includes a commitment to high standards and underscores that customer satisfaction is integral to attaining excellence;
- [x] the policy encourages innovation and adaptability to evolving industry trends and best practices;
- [x] the policy commits to empowering employees with the necessary skills, resources, and support to excel in their roles;
- [x] the policy includes leadership commitment;
- [x] the policy includes a review and revision process;
- [x] the policy is communicated to all employees;
- [x] all employees undergo training to ensure compliance with the principles outlined in the policy;
- [x] there is evidence that these principles are incorporated into daily operations;
- [x] there is evidence of leadership commitment;
- [x] there is evidence of the effectiveness of this excellence-driven approach.

Now, if the organization successfully checks all of these boxes, it ascends to the legendary Level 5 in this focus area! :tada:

A maturity model, like the one I created, provides several advantages, especially in reducing ambiguity, ensuring clarity, and minimizing the potential for misinterpretation or manipulation. It ensures that all stakeholders understand the criteria for each level, promoting consistency in evaluations. Different assessors or teams are also more likely to arrive at a similar score since the criteria are explicitly outlined.

Setting a maturity model up with defined criteria ensures:

- *Reduced Subjectivity* - clearly defined levels help minimize subjective interpretations during assessments;
- *Structured & Measurable Progress* - organizations can track their progress objectively as they move through a structured path for continuous improvement, advancing systematically through the maturity levels;
- *Reduced Manipulation* - the specificity of well-defined levels reduce the opportunity for manipulation or misrepresentation of maturity;
- *Targeted Development & Efficient Resource Allocation* - helps organisations focus their resources on the important areas that will help make progress to the next level;
- *Improved Accountability & Ownership* - teams and individuals have a clear understanding of their responsibilities to achieve and maintain specific levels, thereby promoting accountability.

#### Conclusions
In summary, an Operational Excellence Maturity Model serves as a valuable tool for organizations to assess, plan, and implement improvements in their operational processes. It aligns operations with strategy, promotes a culture of continuous improvement, and ultimately leads to better performance, customer satisfaction, and competitiveness.

There are some existing operational excellence assessments out there that might be applicable in some organisations or work streams. On the other hand, other organizations might choose to create a customized operational excellence maturity model for reasons related to privacy, financial considerations, or compatibility. A customized assessment allows the organisation to focus on specific areas or processes that are critical to the organization's success and can reflect the organization's unique culture, values, and priorities.

The maturity model that I created for this blog post has many benefits, especially in improving clarity and maintaining consistency. It reduces confusion, ensures everyone knows the criteria for each level and prevents misinterpretation or manipulation during assessments.
