To create an operational excellence maturity model, we must first grasp the goal of the model's fundamental ideas, which are continuous improvement and operational excellence. In my previous [blog post](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt1.md), we concentrated on the definition of continuous improvement, and in this blog post, we will focus on the definition of operational excellence. In the third part, we will finally create an operational excellence maturity model.

Now let's get started.

#### What is operational excellence?
There are various definitions for operational excellence in literature, just as there are for continuous improvement. Each definition focuses on a different angle, and the majority of them are similar. According to [1], there are 32 different definitions, with key focus areas spanning from employee and customer satisfaction to continuous development of operational performance. The common theme across these definitions is that operational excellence refers to the intended result or ideal state for a business. 

In [2], operational excellence is described as the “organisational culture of a company, where employees have the ability to identify problems and solve them analytically”. In the work of **Sutton** [3] operational excellence is defined as “a strategic focus on maximizing the value for customers through operations with the support of strong leadership, the power of people, the use of industry best practice and the application of value-added technologies.” According to **Russel and Koch** [4], operational excellence is “reaching the height of operational efficiency through doing things better, faster, and cheaper.” While **Wiersema and Treacy** [5] define operational excellence as “the strategy organizations use to deliver quality, price, ease of purchase and service in such a manner that no other organization in the industry or sector can match.”

Some of these definitions suggest that operational excellence is a strategy, while others refer to operational excellence as a status that a business should aim to achieve. 

However, we won't use these definitions and instead focus on the two following definitions due to their clarity and simplicity:

1) According to Duggan [6], operational excellence is defined as an organizational status “where each and every employee can see the flow of value to the customer and fix that flow before it breaks down.” Duggan’s work suggests that once operational excellence is achieved, there is no need for management involvement in day-to-day operations. This means that employees on every level of the organization know how to fix problems when they arise.

2) In [7], the authors describe operational excellence as a concept that extends beyond individual tools and techniques. It integrates strategic management, organisational culture, and Lean principles. It is a consequence of an enterprise-wide practice of ideal behaviours based on the correct principles. The emphasis in this description is on organisational culture, behaviours, and enterprise-wide adoption. Operational excellence is more than just the utilisation of tools, methods, and procedures. It is about incorporating strategic management and lean principles into the company's culture.

Both of these definitions underline the significance of specific behaviour by individuals within the organisation in order to achieve operational excellence. This means that the company not only ensures that employees at all levels have the information and tools they need to help the organisation achieve operational excellence, but it also instills operational excellence-related behaviour in the culture. To be succesful an organisation needs both the knowledge and a culture that promotes operational excellence.

An organisation will get the benefits of engaged personnel when it invests in its employees and sees the value in their skills, knowledge and opinions. This will promote growth.

#### Key guidelines for establishing operational excellence.

The Shingo Institute [8] categorizes the fundamental principles for developing operational excellence into the following dimensions:

- Cultural Enablers - enable individuals in the organisation to participate in the transformation journey, progress in their understanding and, build a culture of operational excellence 
- Continuous Process Improvement - every employee must know “what good is,” whether his or her process is creating a good product or service, and they must know what to do if it is not
- Enterprise Alignment - develop management systems that align work and behaviours with principles and direction in ways that are simple, comprehensible, actionable and standardized
- Results - all leaders in the organization share one common responsibility: they are responsible for results

  The graphic below displays these dimensions.

These dimensions are the basis for the operational maturity model in my next blog post. Change management plays a big role here, but that is a topic for another day.

#### What advantages does operational excellence offer, then?

- In the work of Duggan [8], managers will have more time to focus on larger initiatives rather than firefighting; if employees can correct the flow of value to the customer and fix that flow before it breaks down with little or no management intervention, managers will have more time to focus on growing the firm. 
- Customers and staff both gain from process streamlining; employees who practise operational excellence are more productive as a result of reduced process waste. This improves the overall client experience.

#### Key takeaways:
We have now examined both continuous improvement and operational excellence. Continuous improvement focuses on the use of tools or a collection of tools and concepts (lean, total quality management, six sigma, and just in time) to eliminate waste and decrease non-value added activities on a continuous basis. Operational excellence integrates improvement concepts into the company's culture. 

We'll discuss the operational excellence maturity model in my next blog post.
