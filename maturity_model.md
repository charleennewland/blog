Many organizations tend to prioritize short-term improvements, often leading to a fixation on quick fixes rather than the pursuit of enduring, sustainable changes. Ideally, an organization aims to strike a balance between short-term gains and long-term objectives and one effective way to achieve this is through the implementation of Operational Excellence. Not every organization chooses existing assessments, whether for financial or privacy reasons, as an approach to pursue operational excellence. 

Existing tools might not fully suit each organization or work stream. Creating a customized model enables the organization to focus on specific critical areas or processes vital for its success. This blog post will explore the process of developing a maturity model for operational excellence.

To develop an operational excellence maturity model, it is essential to understand the fundamental ideas underpinning the model, specifically centered around the principles of [continuous improvement](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt1.md) and [operational excellence](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt2.md). In my two previous posts, I delved into these definitions, so with that foundational knowledge in place, let's now direct our attention to the operational excellence maturity model.

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of what it takes to whip up a tailor-made operational excellence maturity model, let's kick things off with a lighthearted exploration of what in the world a maturity model is, shall we?

#### What exactly do we mean when we say "Maturity Model"?

A quick online search will produce numerous examples of maturity models applied across diverse industries. These models help organizations identify organizational gaps and strengths, which they can then use to develop a proper roadmap to improve crucial workflows or initiatives.

Picture a maturity model like a ladder. At its core, it's made up of assessment criteria, forming the rungs of the ladder, and various maturity levels, all tied together with a handy scoring system. It's like a roadmap for leveling up in excellence!

The study referenced in [1] defines a maturity model as a development of an entity over time. This entity or object can cover a wide range of subjects, from individuals to organizational functions.‌ A maturity model serves as a tool for assessing an organization's performance and continuous growth in a specific domain. Maturity models can be used in a wide range of domains, from project management and software development to information security and operational excellence.

#### Perks of an Operational Excellence Maturity Model

In the hustle and bustle of today's world, operational excellence isn't just a choice; it's a vital necessity for those aiming for long-term success. Now, let's look into the benefits of utilizing an operational excellence maturity model to reach this objective.

>*Benefits of an Operational Excellence Maturity Model according to [2] are:*

- Continuous Improvement; promotes a culture of continuous improvement throughout the organization.
- Strategic Harmony; aligns operational strategies with company objectives for a unified strategy.
- Optimized Resource Utilization; assists in efficient resource utilization, leading to cost savings and increased production.
- Effective Risk Management and Compliance; helps in identifying and managing risks, ensuring compliance, resilience, and adherence to standards.
- Informed Decision-Making; promotes data-driven decisions essential for long-term success.

#### What essentials are required for a top-notch Operational Excellence Maturity Model?

Let’s have a quick look now at the essential ingredients for an operational excellence maturity model. In theory, you have the flexibility to select the principles to base your maturity model on, as long as they align with the organization's goals.We will base our model for this blog post on the Shingo model, since it aligns with the definitions covered in my earlier [blog post on operational excellence](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt2.md).

>*As per the Shingo Institute [2], the fundamental principles for developing operational excellence are categorized into the following dimensions:*

- Cultural Enablers - enable individuals in the organisation to participate in the transformation journey, progress in their understanding and build a culture of operational excellence
- Continuous Process Improvement - every employee must know “what good is,” whether his or her process is creating a good product or service, and they must know what to do if it is not
- Enterprise Alignment - develop management systems that align work and behaviours with principles and direction in ways that are simple, comprehensible, actionable and standardized
- Results - all leaders in the organization share one common responsibility: they are responsible for results

#### Exploring Established Assessment Models

Prior to choosing the Shingo model as the foundation for the customized model, I reviewed several academic sources on assessment models related to operational excellence and continuous improvement. Here is detailed information about the [five assessment models](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/post03/Assessment_models.md) that I've researched for this blog.
 
According to the insights shared in [3], the Shingo assessment distinguishes itself as the only assessment tool that achieves the most well-balanced weighted score across all four dimensions necessary for achieving operational excellence.

These five assessment models, according to [3] fail to cover all aspects or guiding principles that lead to operational excellence, as opposed to the Shingo Assessment, which covers all dimensions of operational excellence. However the expense associated with conducting the Shingo Assessment restricts the ability and frequency of businesses to assess their advancement toward operational excellence. So many organisations will have to fend with creating their own operational excellence assessment models.

#### A tailor-made Operational Excellence Maturity Model

The operational excellence maturity model I've put together for this blog post serves as an assessment tool to gauge an organization's progress in its operational excellence journey.

The model consists of the following 5 dimensions:

- Cultural enablers
- Continuous Process Improvement
- Quality Management
- Enterprise Alignment
- Results

The image below illustrates the breakdown of these dimensions into various focus areas.

<h5 align="center">Operational Excellence Dimensions and Focus Areas</h5>   

The image below showcases four lines of the customized maturity model. The model consists of five distinct levels: "Emerging," "Learning," "Committing," "Accelerating," and "Excelling," with each level specifying its prerequisites. In order to advance, the organization must fulfil the prerequisites for both the higher level and the ones before.

Once all focus areas have been assessed, the organization is assigned an total operational excellence score, allowing it to pinpoint and address areas with lower scores. An organization's overall operational excellence score increases as it performs well across the all areas, indicating progress in the right direction. It is crucial to regularly review and update the maturity model to align with the organization's evolving priorities

#### Conclusions
In summary, an Operational Excellence Maturity Model serves as a valuable tool for organizations to assess, plan, and implement improvements in their operational processes. It aligns operations with strategy, promotes a culture of continuous improvement, and ultimately leads to better performance, customer satisfaction, and competitiveness.

There are some existing operational excellence tools out there that might be applicable in some organisations or work streams. Other organisations might opt to create an customized operational excellence maturity model for privacy, financial, or compatibility reasons. A customized assessment allows the organisation to focus on specific areas or processes that are critical to the organization's success and can reflect the organization's unique culture, values, and priorities.
