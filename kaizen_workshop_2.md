In my previous blog post, we were introduced to the concept of Kaizen, which led us to kaizen events and how to conduct one. A kaizen event, in case you missed it, is a week-long event, usually organized when the organization aims to address urgent business risks, tackle root causes, overcome cross-functional challenges, or sustain continuous improvement practices. We covered the first three steps of the 12-step guide to conducting a kaizen event in the previous post on [kaizen workshops](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshops.md). In this post, we'll delve into value stream mapping. Exciting stuff!

While researching value stream mapping, I realized that the topic deserves its own article due to the amount of information available. This is why I decided to create a standalone piece for value stream mapping.

In case you missed it, here's your high-level guide to rocking a kaizen event:

First, make sure that team members are trained in or are familiar with Lean principles, as these often are the basis of kaizen activities. Remember, not every problem needs a kaizen event or workshop.

1. **Form a cross-functional team**, including members associated with the process;
2. **Define goals and objectives** for the kaizen event;
3. **Conduct a Gemba walk** in the actual workplace;
4. **Create a Value Stream Map (VSM)** to identify opportunities for improvements in the process;
5. **Analyze the root causes** of the identified issues;
6. **Facilitate brainstorming sessions** to share ideas for improvement;
7. **Develop potential solutions** to address the identified issues;
8. **Create a detailed plan** for implementing proposed solutions, defining responsibilities, timelines, and key performance indicators (KPIs);
9. **Run a pilot** to test and refine potential solutions;
10. **Implement planned changes**, adjusting processes and workflows;
11. **Monitor these changes** and evaluate their impact on the process using metrics and KPIs;
12. **Document the entire kaizen event** for future reference and follow-up. 

We've covered steps 1, 2, and 3 in the [previous post](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/kaizen_workshops.md). In this blog post, we will examine **step 4, which involves creating a Value Stream Map**.

**What does academic literature say about Value Stream Mapping?**

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a lean-management tool that originated from the Toyota Production System, developed in the late 1940s and 1950s. The authors in [1] who popularized VSM attribute its principles, such as focusing on value-added activities and eliminating waste, to the lean manufacturing methods developed within the Toyota Production System, primarily by Taiichi Ohno. At its most basic level, it visualises each task in the creation of a service or product, helping us pinpoint waste, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies, all geared towards process optimization. This visualization helps us understand the time each step takes and the distinction between value-added and non-value-added steps within the process. 

According to [2] there are three types of activities that a process consists of. These can be categorized into:
1. non-value adding (NVA);
2. necessary but non-value adding (NNVA); and
3. value-adding (VA).

In process improvement, the goal is to minimize Non-Value Adding (NVA) activities, which do not contribute to customer value, while optimizing Necessary but Non-Value Adding (NNVA) tasks. The focus lies in improving Value-Adding (VA) activities that directly fulfill customer needs. All of theses are aimed at reducing inefficiencies/waste, increasing productivity, and ultimately improving the overall effectiveness of the process.

**Types of waste**

In one of my earlier blog posts on [continuous improvement](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt1.md), I mentioned the eight types of waste the lean philosophy knows. The acronym DOWNTIME is an easy way to remember the eight wastes:

- Defects - products or services that do not meet customers' specifications and require resources to rectify;
- Overproduction - producing products in excess before they are truly needed;
- Waiting - wasting time awaiting a preceding process to finish before moving forward;
- Non-utilized talent - losing time, ideas, skills, and improvements when not involving employees;
- Transportation - excessive movement of resources or information not essential to the product or service;
- Inventory - quantities of products, materials, and information beyond what is immediately necessary;
- Motion - unnecessary movement by people or movement that does not add value to the product or service;
- Extra-processing - an activity that is not required to produce the product or service.

**Navigating the Practical Jungle of Value Stream Mapping**

Now that we've covered the theoretical background, let's look at the practical steps required to create a VSM, using a call center as an example.
As the needs of the customers of this call center have developed, the team recognizes the need to improve and elevate the services.

Picture this: with colorful sticky notes, markers, and a whiteboard at hand, you and your team are all set to tackle the task of creating the Value Stream Map. If you find yourselves unsure of the next steps, don't worry â€” I'm here to help guide you through the process.

Here are the steps you need to take:

- **Draw the map:** Use a whiteboard, flip chart paper, or VSM software to create a visual representation of the current state of the value stream;
- **Identify process steps** Map out the sequence of activities involved in delivering the product or service, including material and information flows;
- **Capture metrics:** Collect data by gathering information on the time required to complete each step in the process. This can be achieved through observation, the use of time tracking software, or by seeking input from employees. Document key performance indicators (KPIs) such as lead time, cycle time, and process efficiency for each process step;
- **Highlight waste:** Identify and mark areas of waste, including overproduction, waiting time, excess inventory, and unnecessary processing;
- **Identify bottlenecks:** Determine points in the value stream where work accumulates or slows down, leading to inefficiencies;
- **Evaluate flow:** Assess the smoothness and continuity of material and information flow throughout the value stream.

After following the above mentioned steps, we end up with the following image, which is the current state map:
<p align="center">
  <img width="1800" height="500" src="https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/assets/138404574/a43c901b-aea0-43ce-9246-b4f22fe9bcfd/600/300"> 
</p>
</p>
<h5 align="center"> Current State Map</h1>  

The 7-minute difference between the cycle time and the process time suggests a significant waiting time for inputs or resources required to complete a call. This waiting time is non-value-added, as it does not directly contribute to resolving the customer's issue. The current state map provides a baseline for comparison when designing a future state map, which you will need to create now by following these steps:

- **Create a leaner process** that eliminates or reduces waste, improves flow, and better aligns production with customer demand, based on the analysis of the current state;
- **Develop a future state map** that reflects these improvements, including changes to process steps, material and information flows, and other key metrics.

The first focus should be on improving areas with low efficiency. The table below outlines the various activities in the customer call process, including their processing times, cycle times, value-added times, total times, process step efficiencies, and suggested improvements/solutions that emerged from the root cause analysis and brainstorming (steps 5, 6, and 7). We will take a closer look at these steps in future posts.

<h5 align="center"> Process Data and Improvements</h1>  

The future state map aims to visually represent the optimized process flow, highlighting improvements and efficiencies gained from the changes made to process steps. Here is the future state map for the call center:

</p>
</p>
<h5 align="center"> Future State Map</h1>  

Successfully implementing these changes will lead to the following quantifiable improvements:

Currently, each call center representative (CCR) handles an average of 21.82 calls per day. After implementing the proposed changes, this figure will increase to 35.56 calls per day per CCR, marking an increase of 62.97%. Additionally, with the suggested automation and streamlining improvements, the potential increase in output for this call center could be even more significant.

Alongside these improvements, there are also non-tangible benefits. These include an increase in employee satisfaction because of the standardization and simplification of process steps, which can also lead to higher employee retention rates.

**Brown Paper Sessions**

Brown paper sessions are not the same as value stream mapping, but they are often used in conjunction with each other as part of a process improvement initiative.

A brown paper session is an interactive meeting where participants use large sheets of brown paper to visually represent ideas, processes, or plans. These sessions are common in brainstorming and process improvement exercises, with participants using markers, sticky notes, or other visual aids for easy sharing and collaboration.

Brown paper sessions can be used as part of the value stream mapping process to brainstorm ideas, gather input from team members, and visually represent the current state and future state of a process. While I personally prefer the brown paper approach, Minitab Workspace and Miro are great alternatives for VSM with remote teams

Here is an image illustrating what a brown paper session looks like.

Summary:
- VSM visualizes each task involved in creating a product or service and helps identify waste, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies.
- To create a VSM, tools such as whiteboards, flip chart paper, or VSM software can be utilized for visualization.
- To develop a leaner process that eliminates or reduces waste and enhances flow, we must analyze the current state map.
- Improvements, including modifications to process steps, material and information flows, and other key metrics, will be documented in the future state map.
