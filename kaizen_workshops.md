Welcome, 2024, even though we're almost through January! As we dive into this 'brand-new' year, it's time for new beginnings, setting goals, adopting healthier lifestyles, hitting the gym, and learning new languages-improvements galore. :sparkles: So, in the spirit of positive changes, let's kick off this January blog post with a focus on kaizen. Buckle up, 2024—we're ready for the ride!

In one of my earlier articles, where I delved into the definition of [continuous improvement](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt1.md), I mentioned the term kaizen (改善). The term 'kaizen' is Japanese for 'change' (kai) and 'good' (zen), highlighting the ongoing effort to improve. According to [1], kaizen was first used in manufacturing settings, but now it's often used in service business processes to drive small changes, regularly reducing waste and continuously improving productivity, safety, and effectiveness.

Imai acknowledges in [2] that kaizen is commonly understood as continuous improvement (CI), but he believes it doesn't capture the significant level of self-discipline and commitment required by everyone during the kaizen process. Therefore, in an effort to highlight that kaizen goes beyond simple CI and involves extensive, organization-wide improvement, he proposes a new interpretation: everyday improvement, everybody improvement, and everywhere improvement.

There are various academic definitions for kaizen, but in this post, I will focus on Imai's definition. This definition emphasizes practical elements, particularly from an organizational hierarchy perspective. It also highlights the distinction between kaizen and innovation.

In [3], Imai differentiates between two types of improvements: kaizen and innovation. Kaizen refers to gradual improvements through continuous efforts, while innovation involves significant improvements achieved by investing in new technology or equipment. In the context of kaizen, management has two key functions: maintenance and improvement. See image 1 below. Maintenance involves preserving current technologies and standards through training and discipline, ensuring adherence to procedures. Improvement focuses on elevating existing standards.

Image 1 is known as the kaizen flag. The flag can be divided into the following three areas:

- **Innovation-** these involve drastic improvements in existing processes;
- **Kaizen-** these entail continuous improvement of existing processes;
- **Maintenance-** these involve activities aimed at preserving existing technologies and standards.

Drawing a horizontal line at each organizational level, as depicted in the image below, helps us understand the amount of time each individual, depending on their level in the organization, should spend focusing on innovation, kaizen, and maintenance activities.

The flag suggests that driving improvements should be part of everyone’s job, and the same applies to maintaining standards, while innovation should be the responsibility of top and middle management.

Kaizen employs a bottom-up approach with a focus on waste elimination. For more information on the types of waste, check out my post on [continuous improvement](https://github.com/charleennewland/blog/blob/main/operational_excellence_pt1.md). Kaizen is simply a method that encourages worker participation, as mentioned in [4], and is promoted through various types of kaizen activities such as suggestions, kaizen teams, and kaizen events. Participation in these activities is typically seen as a way to develop key skills in employees.

#### Kaizen Workshops
Imagine this scenario: you and your team have detected a gradual decline in the output of a process. In a stroke of genius, you declare, 'Enough is enough; it's time for a kaizen workshop!' So, what does this kaizen workshop or event involve? It's a team gathering where the focus is on a specific area or issue that needs improvement. Although I've read about 1-day kaizen events, they typically last a week, with everyone pitching in to find simple and smart ways to improve efficiency and productivity.

Kaizen events are usually organized when the organization aims to address urgent business risks, tackle root causes, overcome cross-functional challenges, or sustain continuous improvement practices.

First, make sure that team members are trained in or are familiar with Lean principles, as these often are the basis of kaizen activities. Remember, not every problem needs a kaizen event or workshop.


Here are the high-level steps for conducting a kaizen workshop:

1. **Form a cross-functional team**, including members associated with the process;
2. **Define goals and objectives** for the kaizen event;
3. **Conduct a Gemba walk** in the actual workplace;
4. **Create a Value Stream Map (VSM)** to identify opportunities for improvements in the process;
5. **Analyze the root causes** of the identified issues;
6. **Facilitate brainstorming sessions** to share ideas for improvement;
7. **Develop potential solutions** to address the identified issues;
8. **Create a detailed plan** for implementing proposed solutions, defining responsibilities, timelines, and key performance indicators (KPIs);
9. **Run a pilot** to test and refine potential solutions;
10. **Implement planned changes**, adjusting processes and workflows;
11. **Monitor these changes** and evaluate their impact on the process using metrics and KPIs;
12. **Document the entire kaizen event** for future reference and follow-up. 

This set of 12 steps provides a framework for a successful kaizen event.

Kaizen workshops offer many advantages. With time, it can promote a cultural shift, inspiring employees to embrace continuous improvement. Some other **benefits** include:

- **Efficiency improvement-** kaizen workshops identify inefficiencies, streamline workflows, and optimize resource utilization;
- **Employee Engagement-** these workshops empower employees, inspire a sense of ownership and encourage active participation in the improvement process;
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration-** kaizen workshops bring employees from different departments together, promoting collaboration and breaking down organizational silos.

Now, let's quickly review the first 3 steps outlined in our kaizen workshop guide.

#### 1. Building the Avengers of Kaizen: Picking Your Dream Team, Cape Optional! :superhero:

Selecting the right team members is crucial for a successful kaizen workshop. You want to include people with knowledge of the process or area that you are trying to improve such as individuals who take part in the process, which will also ensure that they are taking part in selecting the appropriate solution ensuring a higher adoption rate.

Here are some important points to follow when selecting a team:

- **Select a team leader with strong leadership skills.** This individual should be familiar with Lean techniques and have the ability to explain them to team members on the fly;
- **Include key stakeholders with a vested interest in the process** being improved, such as managers, supervisors, and employees directly involved in the targeted area;
- **Include individuals with diverse skills** and expertise, meaning members from different departments who can provide unique insights into the entire value stream;
- **Include subject matter experts (SMEs)** with in-depth knowledge of the specific process under review to propose effective solutions.

#### 2. Goal-setting: Because 'Winging It' Is Not a Kaizen Strategy! :dart:

Defining a goal at the start of a kaizen workshop is critical, as it provides direction and structure. When defining a goal, you answer the following question: What specific problem or improvement are we aiming to address?

Here are some important points to follow when defining goals:

- **Focus on the actual problem** to enhance clarity and unanimous agreement;
- **Clearly articulate the specific problem** or improvement you aim to address, as this will serve as motivation for the team;
- **Ensure all participants share a common understanding** of the goal's purpose;
- **Utilize tools like the SMART framework, benchmarking, and mind mapping** for effective goal definition;
- **Regularly review the goal's relevance** and be prepared to make adjustments based on changing circumstances or new information.


#### 3. The Art of Gemba Walking: A Guide to Not Stumbling! :walking:
Gemba (現場) is a Japanese term that translates to "the actual place" or "the real place". Gemba walk is a hands-on approach that involves going to the actual workplace to observe and understand processes.

- **Create a checklist of areas to observe** and questions to ask. Ensure a focused approach to maximize the value of time on the ground. Perform a pre-analysis of accompanying process data for effective questioning;
- **Engage with frontline workers** by asking questions and actively listening. Encourage them to share their perspectives. Their insights are critical in understanding the real challenges and opportunities;
- **Observe the processes and workflows** and act as a silent observer. Document any deviations, bottlenecks, or areas for improvement using checklists, photographs, or written notes;
- **Approach the Gemba walk with an open mind**, ready for unexpected discoveries, and be willing to adjust preconceptions. This ensures a better understanding of the work environment.

These are the initial three steps in our 12-step guide to a proper kaizen event. In my next blog post, we will delve into the following three steps, which include Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) – two of my favorite tools.

#### The main takeaways here are:

- Kaizen workshops are usually a week-long team gathering for targeted improvement;
- Kaizen workshops drive efficiency, empower employee engagement, and foster cross-functional collaboration;
- Defining goals at the beginning of kaizen workshops is crucial for providing direction and structure;
- Team formation is crucial, including those with process knowledge and key stakeholders for higher adoption rates;
- Gemba walks involve firsthand observation, engaging with frontline workers, and documenting areas for improvement.
