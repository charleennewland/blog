Welcome 2024 (even though we're almost already through January)! As we dive into this 'brand-new' year, let's applaud the timekeepers of the past who defined the year's length.

It's a time for new beginnings, setting goals, adopting healthier lifestyles, hitting the gym, and learning new languages.- Improvements galore. So, in the spirit of positive changes, let's kick off this January blog with a focus on kaizen. Buckle up, 2024—we're ready for the ride!


In one of my earlier blogs where I delved into the definition of continuous improvement, we mentioned the term kaizen. The term 'Kaizen' is Japanese for 'change' (kai) and 'good' (zen), emphasizing the constant pursuit of improvement. 
According to Cheser, while Kaizen has historically been applied to manufacturing settings, it is now commonly applied to service business processes to drive small changes regularly—reducing waste and continuously improving productivity, safety, and effectiveness.[1] (https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/eb028884/full/html)

There are many definitions for Kaizen in academic work, but in this post, I will focus on the definitions of Imai and Hammer because they emphasize the more practical elements, particularly from an organizational hierarchy perspective. They also highlight the difference between Kaizen and innovation.

Hammer et al. emphasize that Kaizen promotes process-oriented thinking, as improvement in processes is necessary to achieve better outcomes. Improvement is classified into Continuous Improvement (CI) and innovation. Kaizen involves incremental improvements through ongoing efforts, while innovation requires significant changes achieved through substantial investments in technology or a radical shift in process design using Business Process Re-engineering (BPR). (https://www.google.nl/books/edition/Reengineering_the_Corporation/DXNzGHOCgWIC?hl=en&gbpv=0&bsq=Reengineering%20the%20Corporation:%20A%20Manifesto%20for%20Business%20Revolution,%20Harper%20Collins,%20New%20York )

Imai differentiates between two types of improvement: Kaizen and innovation. Kaizen means gradual improvements through continuous efforts, while innovation involves substantial improvements achieved by investing in new technology or equipment. In the context of Kaizen, management has two key functions: maintenance and improvement. Maintenance involves preserving current technologies and standards through training and discipline, ensuring adherence to procedures. Improvement focuses on elevating existing standards. (Figure 1). (https://books.google.nl/books/about/Gemba_Kaizen_A_Commonsense_Low_Cost_Appr.html?id=qaqKh6Tp4SsC&redir_esc=y )


In figure 1, there's an image called the Kaizen flag. If we draw a horizontal line at each organizational level (as depicted in the picture below), it helps us know how much each level in the organization should focus on innovation, kaizen and maintenance activities.

-**Innovation;** these are drastic improvements in existing processes
-**Kaizen**; these are continuous improvement of existing processes
-**Maintenance** these are activities aimed at preserving existing technologies and standards.

The flag suggests that driving improvements are part of everyone’s job; the same goes for maintaining standards, while innovation is part of top and middle managements responsibility.


#### Kaizen Workshops

Now imagine this: you and your team have been realizing that your process output has been deteriorating for a while now. In a stroke of genius, you declare, 'Enough is enough; it's time for a Kaizen workshop!' Now, what does this Kaizen workshop involve? 
It's a team gathering where the team focuses on a specific area or issue that needs improvement. This is usually a week-long event. Everyone pitches in to find simple and smart ways to increase efficiency and productivity. 

We organize Kaizen events when we want to address urgent business risks, resolve root causes, overcome cross-functional challenges or sustain continuous improvement practices.

First, make sure that team members are trained in or are familiar with Lean principles, as these often form the basis of Kaizen activities. I also want to note that not all problems require a Kaizen event or workshop. So what does a kaizen event look like? 


Typically a Kaizen workshop may consist of the following:

Below you will find a detailed, step-by-step guide to conducting a Kaizen workshop with 12 comprehensive steps.

1. **Define goals and objectives** for the Kaizen event
2. **Form a cross-functional team**, including members associated with the process.
3. **Conduct a Gemba walk** in the actual workplace.
4. **Create a Value Stream Map (VSM)** to identify for improvements in the process
5. **Facilitate brainstorming sessions** to share ideas for improvement.
6. **Analyze the root causes** of the identified issues
7. **Develop potential solutions** to address the identified issues
8. **Create a detailed plan** for implementing proposed solutions, defining responsibilities, timelines, and key performance indicators (KPIs)
9. **Run a pilot** to test and refine potential solutions.
10. **Implement planned changes**, adjusting processes and workflows
11. **Monitor these changes** and evaluate their impact on the process using metrics and KPIs
12. **Document the entire Kaizen event** for future reference and follow-up 

These 12 steps should serve as a solid guide for a Kaizen event. Now, let's quickly review the first 3 steps in our Kaizen workshop guide.

  Define goals and objectives for the Kaizen event
"Goal-setting: Because 'Winging It' Is Not a Kaizen Strategy!"

Defining a goal is crucial, as it provides direction and structure. When defining a goal, you answer the following question: What specific problem or improvement are we aiming to address?

Here are some important points to follow when defining goals:

- Clearly articulate the specific problem or improvement you aim to address; 
- Motivate the team by establishing a precise goal;
- Focus on the actual problem to enhance clarity and unanimous agreement;
- Ensure all participants share a common understanding of the goal's purpose;
- Utilize tools like the SMART criteria, benchmarking, and mind mapping for effective goal definition;
- Regularly review the goal's relevance and be prepared to make adjustments based on changing circumstances or new information.


#### Building the Avengers of Kaizen: Picking Your Dream Team, Cape Optional!

Selecting the right team members is crucial for a successful kaizen workshop.You want to include people with knowledge of the process or area that you are trying to improve such as individuals who take part in the process, which will also ensure that they are taking part in selecting the appropriate solution ensuring a higher adoption rate resulting in a successful project.

Here are some important points to follow when selecting a team:

- Select a team leader with strong leadership skills. This individual should be familiar with Lean techniques and have the ability to explain them to team members on the fly;
- Include key stakeholders with a vested interest in the process being improved, such as managers, supervisors, and employees directly involved in the targeted area;
- Include individuals with diverse skills and expertise, meaning members from different departments who can provide unique insights into the entire value stream;
- Include subject matter experts (SMEs) with in-depth knowledge of the specific process under review to propose effective solutions.


#### The Art of Gemba Walking: A Guide to Not Stumbling!
The Gemba walk is a hands-on approach that involves going to the actual workplace to observe and understand processes.

- Develop a checklist of areas to observe and questions to ask. Ensure a focused approach to maximize the value of time on the ground. Perform a pre-analysis of accompanying process data for effective questioning;
- Engage with Frontline Workers by asking questions and actively listening. Encourage them to share their perspectives. Their insights are critical in understanding the real challenges and opportunities;
- Observe the processes and workflows and act as a silent observer during processes and workflows. Document any deviations, bottlenecks, or areas for improvement using checklists, photographs, or written notes;
- Approach the Gemba walk with an open mind, ready for unexpected discoveries, and be willing to adjust preconceptions. This ensures a better understanding of the work environment.

These are the first 3 steps of our 12-step guide to a proper Kaizen event. In my next blog, we will go into the next 3 steps, which include Values Stream Mapping (VSM) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Two of my favourite tools.

#### The main takeaways here are:

- Kaizen workshop is a week-long team gathering for targeted improvement;
- Goal definition is crucial for providing direction and structure.
- Team formation is crucial, including those with process knowledge and key stakeholders for higher adoption rates
- Gemba walks involve firsthand observation, engaging with frontline workers, and documenting areas for improvement.
