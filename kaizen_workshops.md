Welcome 2024 (even though we're almost already through January)! As we dive into this 'brand-new' year, let's applaud the timekeepers of the past who defined the year's length.

It's a time for new beginnings, setting goals, adopting healthier lifestyles, hitting the gym, and learning new languages.- Improvements galore. So, in the spirit of positive changes, let's kick off this January blog with a focus on kaizen. Buckle up, 2024—we're ready for the ride!


In one of my earlier blogs where I delved into the definition of continuous improvement, we mentioned the term kaizen. The term 'Kaizen' is Japanese for 'change' (kai) and 'good' (zen), emphasizing the constant pursuit of improvement. 
According to Cheser, while Kaizen has historically been applied to manufacturing settings, it is now commonly applied to service business processes to drive small changes regularly—reducing waste and continuously improving productivity, safety, and effectiveness.[1] (https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/eb028884/full/html)

There are many definitions for Kaizen in academic work, but in this post, I will focus on the definitions of Imai and Hammer because they emphasize the more practical elements, particularly from an organizational hierarchy perspective. They also highlight the difference between Kaizen and innovation.

Hammer et al. emphasize that Kaizen promotes process-oriented thinking, as improvement in processes is necessary to achieve better outcomes. Improvement is classified into Continuous Improvement (CI) and innovation. Kaizen involves incremental improvements through ongoing efforts, while innovation requires significant changes achieved through substantial investments in technology or a radical shift in process design using Business Process Re-engineering (BPR). (https://www.google.nl/books/edition/Reengineering_the_Corporation/DXNzGHOCgWIC?hl=en&gbpv=0&bsq=Reengineering%20the%20Corporation:%20A%20Manifesto%20for%20Business%20Revolution,%20Harper%20Collins,%20New%20York )

Imai differentiates between two types of improvement: Kaizen and innovation. Kaizen means gradual improvements through continuous efforts, while innovation involves substantial improvements achieved by investing in new technology or equipment. In the context of Kaizen, management has two key functions: maintenance and improvement. Maintenance involves preserving current technologies and standards through training and discipline, ensuring adherence to procedures. Improvement focuses on elevating existing standards. (Figure 1). (https://books.google.nl/books/about/Gemba_Kaizen_A_Commonsense_Low_Cost_Appr.html?id=qaqKh6Tp4SsC&redir_esc=y )


In picture 1, there's an image called the Kaizen flag. If we draw a horizontal line at each organizational level (as depicted in the picture below), it helps us know how much each level in the organization should focus on innovation, kaizen and maintenance activities.

-**Innovation;** these are drastic improvements in existing processes
-**Kaizen**; these are continuous improvement of existing processes
-**Maintenance** these are activities aimed at preserving existing technologies and standards.

The flag suggests that driving improvements are part of everyone’s tasks; the same goes for maintaining standards, while innovation is expected from top and middle management.

#### Kaizen Workshops

Now imagine this: you and your team have been realizing that your process output has been deteriorating for a while now. In a stroke of genius, you declare, 'Enough is enough; it's time for a Kaizen workshop!' Now, what does this Kaizen workshop involve? 
It's a team gathering where the team focuses on a specific area or issue that needs improvement. This is usually a week-long event. Everyone pitches in to find simple and smart ways to increase efficiency and productivity. 

We organize Kaizen events when we want to address urgent business risks, resolve root causes, overcome cross-functional challenges or sustain continuous improvement practices.

First, make sure that team members are trained in or are familiar with Lean principles, as these often form the basis of Kaizen activities. I also want to note that not all problems require a Kaizen event or workshop. So what does a kaizen event look like? 


Typically a Kaizen workshop may consist of the following:

Below you will find a detailed, step-by-step guide to conducting a Kaizen workshop with 12 comprehensive steps.

1. Define goals and objectives for the Kaizen event
2. Form a cross-functional team, including members associated with the process.
3. Conduct a Gemba walk in the actual workplace.
4. Create a Value Stream Map (VSM) to identify for improvements in the process
5. Facilitate brainstorming sessions to share ideas for improvement.
6. Analyze the root causes of the identified issues
7. Develop potential solutions to address the identified issues
8. Create a detailed plan for implementing proposed solutions, defining responsibilities, timelines, and key performance indicators (KPIs)
9. Run a pilot to test and refine potential solutions.
10. Execute planned changes, adjusting processes and workflows
11. Monitor implemented changes and evaluate their impact on the process using metrics and KPIs
12. Document the entire Kaizen event for future reference and follow-up 

These 12 steps should serve as a solid guide for a Kaizen event. Now, let's quickly review the first 3 steps in our Kaizen workshop guide.

  #### Benefits of Visual management
  
  Visual management brings numerous advantages to organizational settings. Here are some key benefits:

- *Increased Transparency-* promotes openness and accountability by making crucial information easily visible;
- *Efficient Problem Solving-* enables quick identification of issues through visual signals, facilitating quick resolution;
- *Enhanced Decision-Making-* provides a swift and comprehensive overview for faster, well-informed decision-making by leaders and teams;
- *Employee Engagement-* creates an engaging work environment, encouraging employee involvement in continuous improvement initiatives;
- *Standardized Processes-* utilizes visual aids, like standardized work instructions, ensuring consistency, reducing errors, and promoting quality;
- *Promotes Accountability-* visually displays goals and progress, instills a sense of accountability, motivating team members to meet targets;
- *Supports Lean Principles-* aligns with lean principles such as Just-in-Time and Kanban, promoting efficiency, waste reduction, and a focus on customer value.

Visual management in Lean is a vital bridge between data and people, utilizing visual communication to minimize disruptions. The main goal is to make information easily accessible and understandable at a glance.

#### Summary

Just as holiday decorations and a well-decorated Christmas tree enhance the festive atmosphere, visual management improves organizational communication, promoting efficiency and encouraging efforts to achieve operational excellence. It assists in optimizing processes, communication, and efficiency in the workplace, ultimately increasing the transparency of the value chain. Visual management offers teams a clear, real-time understanding of their journey, efficiently guiding them through complexities.
